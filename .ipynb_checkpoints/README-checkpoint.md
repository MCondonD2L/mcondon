2nd step: md formatting - Notes: not in ipynb files; use md files AND JupyterLab for composing.  E.g.:

### 3 TeLO Notes on BfP

1. which orgs are "deployed" / in the fold 
  a. which orgs 'committed' to any sort of roll-out 
  b. "interested" orgs 
2. how administered? 
   a. DELC? (i.e. - should be a DELC contact for each org deployed) 
   b. HT (or OneRoster?) 
   c. Admin "cycles" (i.e. - frequency of tasks) 
   d. Account Life Cycle Management: principles and (best / OK) practices 
3. Task list for DELCs: 
   a. acct creation 
   b. acct relationship mgmt - and 'control' (exception mgmt - i.e.: parental relationship change mgmt) 
   c. ROLE mgmt - processes and practices and training 
   d. "communication" expectations (ministry board schools parents/teachers/students 4) show me the data
4. -- perhaps biggest: requirement in "USER story format"
   a. AS Data admin, I need usage stats on logins, because we need to use login data as an adoption metric proxy
   b. AS Dat Admin, I need usage data available in BDS, because BDS is the aligned mechanism for data metrics
   c. AS Data Admin, I need data from HT, because that is how BfP accounts are managed
   d. AS Data Admin, I need ROLE/Permissions data, in order to support 80+ board DELCs in managing Parent access
